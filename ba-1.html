<div class="section">
<h1><span>IV. Its Ties With GNU/Linux</span></h1>
<p>The Free and Open-source software (FOSS) movement is closely tied to the GNU/Linux operating system. Linux is an open-source operating system that is based on the Unix operating system, and it was developed in the early 1990s by Linus Torvalds. The Linux kernel, which is the core component of the operating system, is open source, and it is surrounded by a vast collection of free and open-source software applications that provide users with a complete computing environment.</p><p>
    The GNU Project, which was started in 1983 by Richard Stallman, was created to develop a complete Unix-like operating system that would be free and open-source. The goal of the GNU Project was to provide users with complete control over their software and to promote the sharing and collaboration of software development.</p><p>
    The combination of the Linux kernel and the GNU software stack, which includes the GNU C Library, the GNU Core Utilities, and the GNU Compiler Collection, among others, created the GNU/Linux operating system. This operating system is now used by millions of people around the world and is widely recognized as one of the most successful examples of the FOSS movement</p></div>
    <div class="section">
        <h1><span>V. Challenges of Free and Open-source software</span></h1>
